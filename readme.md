## rustz
Rustz is a library for functional programming in Rust.

It provides as-pure-as-useful functional data structures to improve the functional programming experience with Rust. It implements a set of instances of the foundational functional type classes (e.g. Functor, Monad) for a large number of data structures.

The implementation tries to be as close to the pure functional implementations of these data structures, but also tries to remain practical given the specifics of the Rust programming language.

## Some other functional crates

* https://github.com/KitFreddura/Kinder (interesting macro based HKT approach)
* https://github.com/mcoffin/rust-effect-monad (Contains trampoline impl.)
* https://github.com/tempbottle/monad.rs
* https://github.com/ludat/hado-rs (macro for do expressions / for comprehensions)
* https://github.com/TeXitoi/rust-mdo (macro for do expressions / for comprehensions)
* https://github.com/danslapman/rust-mdo-future (Future support for mdo)
* https://github.com/ptal/partial Similar to Option<T> with an additional Fake variant for accumulating errors beyond the first one. For example, in compiler, if a code analysis failed, we wish to continue a little further to obtain more errors.
* https://github.com/srijs/rust-operational (Contains e.g. Kleisli)
* https://github.com/m4rw3r/chomp (Parsing)
* https://github.com/asajeffrey/parsell (Parsing)
* https://github.com/mgattozzi/curryrs Curryrs (a play on the name of Haskell Curry, rs for Rust libraries, and it's pronunciation couriers) is a library for providing easy to use bindings between Rust and Haskell Code. Given the type safety inherent in both languages Curryrs seeks to bridge the gap between the two languages by providing an interface between the two that makes writing FFI code a relatively painless experience.
